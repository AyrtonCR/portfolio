### <u> Overview</u>

<br>

This project is a responsive web app designed as a landing page to show off some of the other projects I am working on. <br>

Built with ReactJS, the web page will include some different features that are aimed at easily showcasing some of the technologies I am familar with, and what I am currently working on.


<br>

Some of the features this app will include are ...

<br>

- Clearly showcase my other projects.
- Display a nav bar with a pop out menu that links to my other projects.
- Utilize the motion framer animation library to add some sleek animations when scrolling.
- Include clickable arrows to scroll through the contents of the page.
- Have responsive capability depending on what the user is viewing the page with.

The application is currently deployed using `Render` to host the `Client`, and there is no `API` or `DB`.
