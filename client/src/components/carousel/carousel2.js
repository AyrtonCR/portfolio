          I am a Full-stack web developer from Christchurch, NZ. <br />
          <br /> My aim â€” to consistently create, deliver and maintain
          high-quality web applications using modern industry standard
          technologies. I really enjoy being a part of building solutions that
          last. <br />
          <br />I am highly motivated and skilled in working with Front-end,
          Back-end, Databases and UX Design. Currently I enjoy building with
          Javascript and React due to it's versatility.
          <br />

        <p className={style.introText2}>
          Previously, I worked as an electrician in the commercial construction
          industry.
          <br /> <br /> In search of a job that was easier on my body I branched
          out into IT completing a Diploma in Web Development and learning to
          build applications and websites.
          <br />
          <br />
          While I do enjoy web development there are many other things in life
          that keep me busy. <br /> <br />I am a very keen surfer and also
          really enjoy playing guitar, creating music, and spending time with my
          friends and family.
